# Crop_Yield_Analysis

 This project involves analyzing crop yield based on data such as crop type, rainfall, and land area. The analysis is conducted using Python, with a focus on both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.

Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Performed thorough data exploration using Pandas to clean, manipulate, and analyze the dataset.
Visualized trends and patterns in the data using Seaborn, focusing on the relationships between crop yield, rainfall, and land area.
Predictive Modeling:

Developed and trained predictive models using Linear Regression and Gaussian Regression to estimate crop yield.
Leveraged NumPy for numerical operations and data handling.
Deployment:

Deployed the predictive models using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application that provides real-time crop yield predictions.
